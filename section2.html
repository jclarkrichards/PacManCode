    <h2>Section 2: Node Based Movement</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Basics</h3>
      <p>Like I mentioned in the previous section, Pacman is currently able to move anywhere he wants to move.  This isn't the kind of movement we want though.  If you've played Pacman before, and I'm sure you have if you're reading this, then you know that he can only move around within a maze.  So we need to figure out a way to constrain his movement.  When I first wrote a Pacman game I did this by checking for wall collisions.  I defined the maze to be a bunch of walls and checked if Pacman was colliding with the walls and basically just keeping him in between the walls.  This may seem like a good solution, but it's not.  I ran into a lot of issues that I won't discuss here, but I eventually thought of a way better method.  That method is defining the maze as a map of connected nodes.  That was a huge revelation for me and it solved all of the issues I was facing with collision detection.  I'll go over what I mean by a "map of connected nodes" below and we'll generate a simple maze for Pacman to traverse as we're learning the basics of this.</p>
      <h3>Node Maps</h3>
      <p>Maybe you've studied data structures, but it's more than likely you haven't.  That's fine, you don't need a degree in computer science to understand this stuff, I don't have one.  Let's start off with defining what a Node is.  A Node is really anything you want it to be.  It's a very abstract thing.  It's basically an abstract object that contains information.  Usually when you're talking about nodes in video games, one of the most important pieces of information is the position of the node.  You can also represent a node any way you like, we're going to represent a node as a red circle.  Nodes by themselves aren't that interesting.  They become way more interesting when you start linking them up together.  When we have two nodes that are directly linked together we say that they are neighbors.  Being a neighbor to any particular node has nothing to do with proximity.  Two nodes can be right next to each other, but if they are not linked together, then they are not neighbors.  If two nodes are connected to each other, then they are connected by a path.  We'll represent a path by a straight line that joins two nodes together.  That's how we can know visually that two nodes are connected to each other.  When you have a bunch of nodes linked together in various ways, then that is called a node map.  You've probably seen node maps before, they can be used in various ways.  For example, representing a network of computers like the internet.  Node maps can look like of meshy.  Our node map that we'll make for our game will be a simplified version.  The main restriction we'll place on our node map is that each node can only have a maximum of 4 neighbors.  This is because Pacman can only move in four directions:  UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.  So a node can be connected to four other nodes in those four directions.  Also a node can only have a maximum of one neighbor in any one direction.  By that I mean a node cannot be connected to two or more nodes to the RIGHT of him, for example.  If he is connected to a node on his RIGHT, there can only be one node to his RIGHT.  </p>





      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>What we need to do is initialize a clock.  We add this line of code in our <span class="mn">__init__</span> method in the gamecontrol.py file.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="codeText">
	<span class="kw">self</span>.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>Now in our <span class="mn">update</span> method in the gamecontrol.py file we'll add the following.  We divide it by 1000.0 because clock.tick returns the time in milliseconds and we want our &Delta;t to be in seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="codeText">
	dt = <span class="kw">self</span>.clock.tick(30) / 1000.0
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <p>How do we deal with the velocity in our equation?  Well, velocity is a vector and we've already covered vectors and have a Vector2D class waiting for us to use.  The magnitude of velocity is speed, and the direction of velocity is just whatever direction we're moving in.  We can rewrite velocity as speed * direction where direction is a unit vector.  So our equation now becomes:</p>
      <p><b><span class="equations">s(t) = s<sub>0</sub> + speed*direction*&Delta;t</span></b></p>
      <p>Speed is just some scalar value that we'll have to play around with in order to find the right value.  The direction is a unit vector that has a length of 1 and points in the direction we need to move the object.  Luckily for us Pacman can only move in one of four possible directions:  UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  These directions never change so lets add them to our constants.py file.  </p>
      
      <hr/>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>First off, in order to use vectors we'll have to import the Vector2D class.  So that line goes on the top of the file.  The rest can go anywhere in the file, they don't have to come directly after the <span class="kw">import</span>.  Notice that I also included a <span class="var">STOP</span> vector which is a zero vector.  We'll need that because sometimes Pacman isn't moving, and giving him this vector will stop him in his tracks.  I also went ahead and declared another color:  <span class="var">YELLOW</span>.  Because that's the color we're going to make our Pacman object.</p>

      <div class="codeText">

      <p></p>
      <p>Right now this doesn't do anything useful because we don't have an object to apply it to.  Let's create an object called Pacman, that is the whole point of this website after all.  We're going to create a new file called pacman.py and add the following to it.</p>
      <hr/>
      
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>We first import everything we need to import.  This should start to look familiar to you.  When we create a Pacman object we'll give it a name of <span class="str">"pacman"</span>.  We don't have to do this, but it'll come in handy later on.  We also give it an initial position of (200, 400).  This will change later on, but for now you can input any initial position here.  The initial direction of Pacman is <span class="var">STOP</span> because we don't want him moving unless we say so.  We also specify his speed, color, and radius.  The radius is just how big we want him to be since at this time we're just going to represent Pacman as a yellow circle with a radius of 10 pixels.  In the <span class="mn">update</span> method we calculate his new position based on the equation above.  Notice that if his direction is <span class="var">STOP</span> then his position doesn't change.  We also check for key presses since we want to detect if the user is pressing the correct keys.  If we detect that the user has pressed either the UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT keys then we call the <span class="mn">move</span> method and pass in the corresponding direction.  Right now the <span class="mn">move</span> method just sets the direction, but it will do a lot more soon.  We also need to be able to draw Pacman to the screen so we include his own <span class="mn">render</span> method here.  Like I said before we're representing him as a circle, so that's what we'll draw to the screen.  </p>

      <p>Now that we have our Pacman class written we need to use it by creating a Pacman object.  So let's add the following code into our gamecontrol.py file.  I'm not going to write out the entire class like before, just where we need to make the changes.  Everything else stays the same.  </p>

	<p>Somewhere at the top of the file we need to import our Pacman class.</p>

	<p>Finally we update our <span class="mn">render</span> method by adding these two new lines of code.  The first one we add in order to redraw the background.  If we don't add this then if there are any objects that move then they'll appear as if they are smearing across the screen.  We need to erase the objects and redraw them at their new positions.  The object will still move, but all of the images of the object at the previous positions will still be on screen as well.  So we need to basically erase all of the objects and redraw them at their new positions.  Try the code out with this line commented out to see what I mean.  And of course we need to tell the Pacman object to render as well.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>So we have a Pacman object that is able to move around the screen.  That's at least more exciting than the last section, right?  We still don't have a game here, just a yellow circle that responds to certain keys.  Right now, Pacman is able to move anywhere he wants on the screen.  Last time I checked Pacman was constrained to only be able to move within a maze.  In the next section I'm going to show you how to constrain his movement by having him move on a predefined grid.</p>
