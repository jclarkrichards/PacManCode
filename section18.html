    <h2>Section 18: Tying Up Loose Ends</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>We pretty much have a finished Pacman games at this point.  I know that it doesn't look sexy or anything.  There's no graphics, sound, or splash screens.  All we have are circles and lines.  That's really all you need to make this game though.  You can think of this version as the Atari version.  In the next phase we'll add the flash and pizaz.  But, we're still not quite finished with the Atari version.  There are a few loose ends that we need to tie up.  There aren't very many, and they won't change the way the game is played or anything.  But, they will help in making the game feel more like Pacman even without the graphics.</p>
      <p>Below is a list of things we need to address and solve before this section is through.
	<ol>
	  <li>We need to modify Blinky's scatter goal.  You may have noticed that ever since we forced him to move LEFT at the start of the game he just circles around the ghost home instead of the upper right corner.  I'll explain why and what we will do to fix it</li>
	<li>When the ghosts change modes, they actually need to reverse direction.  I may have mentioned before that the ghosts never backtrack when they reach a node.  This is normally true.  However, whenever they change modes they do reverse their direction as a visual cue to the player.  It's not a necessary addition, but we'll include it in our game.</li>
	<li>On that same note, the ghosts also reverse direction whenver Pacman eats a power pellet.  This is really the same thing as the previous point because when Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghost's mode changes, so they should reverse direction.</li>
	<li>I should also point out that the reversing direction rule when the mode changes isn't always true.  For example, the ghost should not reverse direction when the mode changes from FREIGHT to SPAWN.  The ghost should also not reverse direction when the mode changes from SPAWN to any other mode.  So, really what I'm saying is that the ghosts only reverse direction when their modes change from any mode to FREIGHT and when they change from SCATTER to CHASE and from CHASE to SCATTER.  </li>
	<li>When Pacman eats a ghost that is in FREIGHT mode, the game pauses for half a second.  The game does not pause when Pacman eats a fruit, however.  </li>
	<li>We need to make the collision radiuses for Pacman and the Ghosts a bit smaller.  They really shouldn't collide unless they're right on top of each other.  We should allow a bit of overlap of the objects before we register a collision.  It just looks better that way. </li>
	<li>When Pacman loses a life, we need to pause the game for one second.  This time will be used to show the death animation later on in the next phase.</li>
	  <li>It would also be nice to get rid of some of the hard-coded values.  I know at the time I mentioned that I was going to eventually do that.  Well, now is the time.</li>
	  <li>When a certain number of points have been reached, it would be nice to give the player an extra life.  They can get an extra life at every 10,000 point marker.  The maximum number of lives should never be more than 5 however.</li>
      </ol></p>

      <h3>Modifying the Scatter Goals</h3>
      <p>So why isn't Blinky going to the upper right corner like he was before?  When we play the game as it now is, he just circles the ghost home.  Don't worry, there isn't anything wrong with the code.  Blinky is just following instructions.  At the start of the game we're forcing him to move LEFT.  He can't move UP at the first node he comes to because we're restricting that direction on that node for all of the ghosts.  So he has to continue LEFT until he gets to the next node, which only has one possible direction which is DOWN.  At this point Pinky correctly moves to the LEFT, then UP and to his corner, but Blinky continues moving DOWN.  It's just that he has determined that moving DOWN will get him closer to his goal than moving LEFT.  It seems wrong, but if we actually calculate it, it's true.  </p>
      <p>Let's do it ourselves.  Blinky's scatter goal in (column, row) format is (28, 0).  That's the upper right corner of the screen because the screen is 28 columns wide.  The node where he moves DOWN instead of moving LEFT is at (9, 17).  When Blinky gets to this point he needs to figure out which direction will get hime closer to his goal.  Remember we do that by hypothetically asking ourselves if we were to move one unit in each direction, and then comparing the distances from all of those positions to the goal, which distance is the shortest?  We only have two directions here:  DOWN and LEFT.  One unit DOWN is (9, 18) and one unit LEFT is (8, 17).  Checking the DOWN direction, the distance from (9, 18) to (28, 0) is 685.  The actual distance is the square root of 685, but we're comparing distances so there's no point in taking the square root.  Checking the LEFT direction, the distance from (8, 17) to (28, 0) is 689.  So that's why Blinky chooses the DOWN direction because 685 &lt 689.  But we would like him to move LEFT at this node so we need to adjust his scatter goal.  We can try (27, 0), (26, 0) and so on until we find a point where moving LEFT at that node is the shorter distance.  You can do it yourself, it's not hard and won't take that long, but I'll just go ahead and tell you that that position is (22, 0).  </p>

      <h3>Pausing While Eating a Ghost</h3>
      <p>When Pacman eats a ghost that is in FREIGHT mode, the game needs to pause for half a second.  Play any Pacman game and you'll know that this is true.  We don't need to do this, but I kind of like it.  I don't know why, maybe it offers a small break in the action or something, or maybe it's just there to let the player know that they've just eaten a ghost.  Anyways, the only way the game pauses right now is if the player presses the space bar.  We now need a way for the game to pause for a specific amount of time, then unpause itself.  We also need a way to differentiate between these two types of pauses: a pause initiated by the game, and a pause initiated by the player.</p>

      <h3>Getting Rid of Hard-Coded Values</h3>
      <p>Having hard-coded values makes it harder to implement more mazes, which we eventually want to do.  There are some things that are common to all mazes and there are things that are unique to each maze.  The things that are unique to each maze we've been putting in the MAZEDATA dictionary.  For example, things that we are currently hard-coding in are:
      <ol>
	<li>Pacaman's starting position</li>
	<li>The Ghost's starting positino</li>
	<li>The fruit's position</li>
	<li>The home node for the ghost home</li>
	<li>Portal nodes</li>
	<li>Nodes that restrict UP movement</li>
      </ol>
      It would be nice if we didn't have to figure out which node values we need to input into the MAZEDATA dictionary for a particular maze.  In order to do that though, we'll need to introduce a few more symbols for the <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> class.  We've created new symbols before when we put in the pellets, so this concept shouldn't be new.  We'll follow the same procedures, just with a few more symbols.  The new symbols we're going to include are:
      <ol>
	<li>"M": Pacman's starting node.  This will tell the program what value to place in MAZEDATA["start"]["pacman"].  We are using an "M" because we are already using "P" for the pellets.  The symbol just has to be unique, so "M" is just as good as any symbol.  </li>

      <h3>Gaining Extra Lives</h3>
      <p>We want to give the player an extra life every time they gain 10,000 points.  However, they can still never have more than 5 extra lives at any one time.  So if they already have 5 extra lives by the time they reach 10,000 points, then they won't get a sixth extra life.  The first chance at an extra life should come at the 10,000 point mark.  The second chance for an extra life should come at the 20,000 point mark and so on.  The difficulty comes when we realize that the player may not land exactly on the 10,000 point mark, but will most likely jump past it.  For example, the player at one point may have 9,900 points, then the player eats a fruit worth 1000 points which will make the player's score jump to 10,900 points.  What we need to do is check the score before and after in order to see exactly when the player passes the 10,000 point mark.  In order to do that we'll need to have a score accumulator which will gather the points earned in any one frame. </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Well, there you have it.  I think we can actually call this a game.  It has a start and an ending.  There are goals to achieve, and it's something you can get better at with repeated play.  Even so, nobody would bat an eyelash at this as it stands.  People have come to expect some form of graphics in their games.  Animation, sound, and music is also a given.  None of that really affects the way the game is played, so that's why I didn't cover any of that in this phase.  This phase was all about getting the gameplay down.  Now that we have that we can focus on adding the visual aspects of the game.  It's important to note that anything we add from here on out should not change the way the game is played or break the game.  Anything we add should only change the way the game looks.  Before we end this phase, let me show you how to add more mazes in the next section.</p>
