    <h2>Section 11: Giving the Ghosts a Home</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p><img src="Images/mazewithouthome.png" alt=""/>Everyone needs a home, even these mean old ghosts.  In the Pacman games the ghost's home is usually located in the middle of the maze and is easily recognized as a big rectangular box.  Pacman is never allowed to enter this region.  The ghosts themselves don't go in unless they've been eaten by Pacman and they need to respawn.  Three of the ghosts also start in this area when a level starts.  Other than those situations this area remains pretty much empty.  In the image on the right this area is the large empty rectangular area in the middle of the maze.  The ghosts are going to have to sometimes enter this area so we'll need to add some more nodes so that they may do so.  </p>
      <hr/>
      <p><img src="Images/homenodes.png" alt=""/>These are the nodes we would like to add in the middle of the maze.  They are labeled 1-8 so that you'll know which node I'm talking about when discussing these nodes individually.  For example, nodes 2, 3, and 4 are the spawn nodes for all of the ghosts.  Node 1 is the node that connects this set of nodes with the larger set of nodes we've already created.  That's what's great about using linked nodes.  You can create multiple sets of nodes in isolation, then link them all together with just one point.  So why didn't we just inlclude these nodes in the <span class="filenames">maze1.txt</span> file originally?  The reason is mainly because they are kind of off the grid so to speak.  For example, Node 1 has to sit exactly between two nodes.  If we placed these nodes in the original file, then these nodes would have to be skewed either to the left or to the right.  I think it's just a better idea to create both node sets separately, then stitch them together.  </p>

	Well, this node file is a lot easier than the previous one we just made.  We can probably get away with doing this one by hand, but we spent all of that time creating a way to create nodes automatically we might as well use it.  It doesn't matter how large or small the file is, so it shouldn't be a problem.

	<p>When we create the home nodes from the text file, it assumes that we want to position the nodes starting at the upper left corner of the screen.  So, if we did nothing else after creating the nodes, they would appear in the upper left corner of the screen.  However, we actually want to position them between two known nodes from the <span class="var">nodeList</span> list.  We are storing the position of those nodes in the MAZEDATA dictionary (although not yet, we will after this).  We are storing them in the MAZEDATA dictionary because those two nodes are dependent on the maze.  Once we get the two <span class="cn">Node</span> objects, we determine the vector that points to their midpoint.  We then use that vector to place all of the home nodes right where we want them.  They'll also retain their original structure.  Then we finally stitch the two node sets together with the final four lines.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p><img src="Images/mazewithhome.png" alt=""/>We now have all of the nodes we'll ever have to worry about for this game.  If you were to play this game yourself as it is, then you'd notice that Pacman and the ghost are able to move into the home nodes.  We want to prevent Pacman from doing that.  We also want to prevent the ghosts from doing that as well, except when we explicitly tell them to do so.  At this point, the one time the ghost may enter the home node is in order to respawn after Pacman has eaten the ghost.  So, in the next section we are going to have Pacman eat the ghost (only after eating a power pellet of course), and then have the ghost run back home in order to respawn.</p>
