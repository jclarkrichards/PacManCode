      <p><img class="profileImage" src="profileSmall.png" alt="profile image" />I don't know why I like Pac-Man so much.  I mean it's clear that I do like it if I dediated an entire website to everything that is Pac-Man.  I'm not even that good at it, I don't think I've ever gotten past level 10.  I think it just started when I was trying to figure out how to program my own version of Pac-Man years ago in the C language.  Then when I started to learn Python I thought it would be fun to program a version in that language for some reason.  I was very proud of my implementation so I decided that I wanted to share it with people who might be interested.  I'm hoping that you can find this website useful, and at the very least a little bit entertaining.</p>
      <p>I think I like it so much is because it is kind of fun to program.  You learn a lot of great programming concepts programming Pac-Man from basic collision detection to AI.  It has most game elements that bigger games have, and I think that it provides a great framework for making your own unique games.  </p>
