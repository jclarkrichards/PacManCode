    <h2>Section 15: Adding Bonus Fruit</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>So all Pacman really does is eat doesn't he?  He eats the pellets, the ghosts when he can, and he also eats fruit.  Well, he ate things other than fruit in the original game like the Galaxian ship.  But in this game we'll just stick to fruit.  Fruit is healthy and I'm not sure what those pellets are made out of.</p>
      <p>There are several different kinds of fruit and each kind of fruit has a different point value associated with it.  In the lower levels the lower valued fruit appear, for example.  Only one kind of fruit appears in any given level, and it appears twice during that level.  In the original Pacman game, the fruit was stationary and appeared right under the ghost's home.  When the fruit did appear it only stayed on screen for about 10 seconds before disappearing.  Pacman has to eat the fruit before it disappears if he wants to get the points from the fruit.  In the Ms. Pacman games, the fruit hopped around the maze along a certain path and would enter the maze via one portal and leave via the other portal.  For now we'll just have the fruit stationary.</p>
      <p>So our fruit, when it appears, will appear just below the ghost's home in the middle between the two nodes.  So we'll need to place the fruit similar to how we place Pacman between two nodes at the start of a level.  There are also two types of fruit:  the type you collect and the type that is displayed.  When Pacman eats a fruit (the collected kind), it appears in the lower right corner of the screen (the displayed kind).  They look the same, sure, but they do different things.  The collected kind gives Pacman points, it disappears after a certain period of time, and may bounce around the map sometime in the future.  The displayed fruit just sits there doing nothing, other than checking to make sure it's the only unique one being displayed.  Maybe it will be able to do other things like twinkle periodically or something, I don't know.</p>

The <span class="nw">DisplayedFruit</span> class creates objects that appear in the lower right corner of the screen.

These fruit aren't interactable and are only used to display the fruit that Pacman has collected during the game.</p>

      <h3>Increasing the Level</h3>
      <p>Right now we're stuck on level 0.  Even if we complete a level by eating all of the pellets we'll still be on level 0.  That's because we only have one maze and we extract data for that maze from the MAZEDATA dictionary.  Even though we only have one maze we still want to increase the level.  I mean, in the end this game should have an infinite number of levels, but it won't have an infinite number of mazes.  We'll probably only make a maximum of 10 different mazes in this game.  You can go ahead and make as many, or as few, as you want.  We need a way of increasing the level, but also extracting the right data from MAZEDATA.  What I mean if we only have 1 maze and I'm on level 23 then I should be extracting the data from MAZEDATA[0].  If I have 2 mazes and I'm on level 23, then I should be extracting data from MAZEDATA[1].  We're also going to make our mazes cyclical, which means if we only have 3 mazes, for example, then on the 4th level we go back to the 1st maze.  </p>

      <h3>Make More Fruit</h3>
      <p>The reason we're dealing with the level situation in this section is because we want to add more fruit.  We only have one fruit so far, and it's just an abstract generic fruit at that.  But, we only have one type of fruit appearing on each level.  Since we weren't increasing the levels, then we would only see that one type of fruit.  We want to add more fruit, so we had to increase the levels first.  The fruit is not dependent on the maze, so this isn't data that we'll add to MAZEDATA.  If that were the case then we'd be stuck with one fruit since we only have one maze right now.  We can have one or two mazes, but potentially have at least a dozen different fruit.  So, let's make at least 5 different types of fruit, then figure out how to include them in the levels.  Right now the only difference between two different fruit are the name, color, and value.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>So now we have fruit appearing that will give Pacman two additional opportunities to score more points if he eats them in time.  If he does eat the fruit, then it will appear in the lower right corner of the screen.  We also added a way to increase the levels to infinity, and added an easy way to include more mazes and fruit.  We currently have 5 different types of fruit that Pacman can eat, but it's easy to add more.  This actually ended up being a pretty long section.  But we have the fruit out of the way.  The only time we'll have to revisit the fruit if we decide to make the fruit bounce around the maze like in Ms. Pacman, but we'll leave that alone for now.  Dare I say it's about time we add in the other ghosts?  Well alright.  It's just not Pacman with only one ghost, so in the next section we'll add in the other three ghosts and give Pacman a real challenge.</p>
