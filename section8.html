    <h2>Section 8: Pellets and Power Pellets</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>One thing that we all know about Pacman is that he eats a lot of pellets.  Pellets are placed throughout the maze and it's Pacmans primary purpose to eat all of the pellets.  That's the only way we know that the level is complete, once all of the pellets are gone we move on to the next level.  There are also 4 big power pellets at each of the 4 corners of the maze.  If Pacman eats these power pellets then the ghosts become vulnerable and he can then eat the ghosts.  Right now let's just worry about how to get the pellets in the maze to begin with.</p>
      <p>If you were to count up all of the power pellets in the original Pacman game, then there would be a total of 244 pellets.  240 of those pellets are regular pellets that are each worth 10 points.  4 of those pellets are the power pellets that are each worth 50 points.  So just by finishing the level you'll get 2600 points just from the power pellets.</p>
      <p>If you were also to look at the original Pacman game you'll notice that all of the paths don't have pellets.  So you might think that we have to manually place the pellets, but I think we're beyond that by now.  We already have a good solution in place, sort of.  Remember back when we created all of the nodes?  We can just modify that code to create all of the pellets as well.  In order to do that though we'll have to modify the text file that defines the maze with the "+", "-", and "|" symbols.  We'll introduce some new symbols so that the program will know when to place a pellet or a power pellet as it's building the maze.  

      <dl>
	<dt>"p":</dt>
	<dd>Anywhere we want to place a regular pellet on a path, we will use this symbol instead of the "-" or "|" symbols.  However, we won't use this symbol when placing a regular pellet on a node.  Look below for that.</dd>
	<dt>"P":</dt>
	<dd>Anywhere we want to place a power pellet on a path, we will use this symbol instead of the "-" or "|" symbols.  However, we won't use this symbol when placing power pellets on nodes.  Look below for that.</dd>
	<dt>"n":</dt>
	<dd>Anywhere we want to place a regular pellet on a node, we will use this symbol instead of the "+" symbol.</dd>
	<dt>"N"</dt>
	<dd>Anywhere we want to place a power pellet on a node, we will use this symbol instead of the "+" symbol.</dd>
      </dl></p>
      <p>We will still use the "+", "-", and "|" symbols for areas where we're not placing pellets.</p>
