    <h2>Section 4: Automatic Node Maps</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>So we want to generate a maze automatically instead of having to manually create and connect all of the nodes together.  This could save a lot of time since in a normal Pacman maze there could be up to 100 nodes to create and connect together.  What I would like to do is have a text file that defines the maze.  I would then like to use that text file as an input to some method and then have that method output the required nodeList.  The file should be something that is easy for us to make, and also something that the computer can easily parse.  So we need a system of symbols that lets the computer know what should be interpreted as a node and what should be interpreted as empty space and so on.  I'll use the following four symbols:
      <ul>
	<li><b>"0"</b>: empty space</li>
	<li><b>"+"</b>: Node</li>
	<li><b>"-"</b>: horizontal path</li>
	<li><b>"|"</b>: vertical path</li>
      </ul>
      
With using only these symbols I should be able to generate a text file of any size that defines a maze.  If we were to convert the previous nodes we've been using in the last sections into a text file, then it would look like the following image on the left.</p>
      <div class="codeText">
	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br>
	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br>
	0 + - - + 0 0 0<br>
	0 | 0 0 | 0 0 0<br>
	0 + - - + - + 0<br>
	0 | 0 0 0 0 | 0<br>
	0 | 0 0 0 0 | 0<br>
	0 + - - - - + 0<br>
	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br>
      </div>
      <p>There are a few things we need to understand about this text file.  First off, <span class="important">a path will always lead to another node.</span>  There should never be a path that leads to nothing.  It wouldn't make much sense otherwise.  Also, two nodes are equal if and only if they are located in the same row and the same column.  This is important to remember as we're writing the code because the computer may generate the same node twice.  You'll see why when we get to the code, but if it does generate the same node we need to check for node equality.  The only way to do that is to define what it means to be equal.  <span class="important">Remember, two nodes are equal if and only if they have the same x and y values.</span></p>

      <h4>Modify the <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> class in the <span class="mn">nodes.py</span> file</h4>

      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>We're going to spend most of our time in the <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> class.  We need to define a few new variables that we'll need.  In order to create the node map from a text file we need to get the text file first.  So when we create a <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> object we give it the name and path of the text file we want to use.  This is what the <span class="var">level</span> variable is for.  It just holds the path and name of the file in a string format.  The <span class="var">grid</span> variable will hold the values in the text file as a 2D array.  We'll also use a stack so we need to <span class="kw">import</span> it at the beginning of the file.  We are also going to need numpy's <span class="mn">loadtxt</span> method so we need to import that.</p>

      <h4>Create new method called <span class="mn">createNodeList</span></h4>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>This is the main method that we'll call in order to make the node map from the file.  You'll notice that there are several methods that we haven't defined yet.  Those methods are defined below, but this method will give you an overview of what we are doing, then the methods will go into more detail.  We first load the text file into the <span class="var">grid</span> variable as a two-dimensional numpy array of strings.  We then call a method called <span class="mn">findFirstNode</span> which will find the first node in the <span class="var">grid</span> array and return it.  We need a starting point before we can begin.  Once we find that we add it to the stack.  We then start a while loop that will continue as long as the stack is not empty.  Once the stack is empty, then we are finished.  For each iteration through the loop we first pop off the top node from the stack.  We then add that node to the nodeList if it isn't in the nodeList already.  The method <span class="mn">addNode</span> takes care of that.  We then find all of the node's neighbors in all four directions, and add them to the node's neighbors dictionary.  Finally, we add all of the node's neighbors we just found to the stack.  This continues until we've popped off all of the nodes.</p>
