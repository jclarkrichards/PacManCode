    <h2>Section 4: Automatic Node Maps</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>So we want to generate a maze automatically instead of having to manually create and connect all of the nodes together.  This could save a lot of time since in a normal Pacman maze there could be up to 100 nodes to create and connect together.  What I would like to do is have a text file that defines the maze.  I would then like to use that text file as an input to some method and then have that method output the required nodeList.  The file should be something that is easy for us to make, and also something that the computer can easily parse.  So we need a system of symbols that lets the computer know what should be interpreted as a node and what should be interpreted as empty space and so on.  I'll use the following four symbols:
      <ul>
	<li><b>"0"</b>: empty space</li>
	<li><b>"+"</b>: Node</li>
	<li><b>"-"</b>: horizontal path</li>
	<li><b>"|"</b>: vertical path</li>
      </ul>
      
With using only these symbols I should be able to generate a text file of any size that defines a maze.  If we were to convert the previous nodes we've been using in the last sections into a text file, then it would look like the following image on the right.  In fact, go ahead and create a text file similar to the image on the right and save it in the same directory as all of our other files.  You don't have to copy the image exactly, but you can initially, then when you see things working you can get creative.</p>

      <p>There are a few things we need to understand about this text file.  First off, <span class="important">a path will always lead to another node.</span>  There should never be a path that leads to nothing.  It wouldn't make much sense otherwise.  Also, two nodes are equal if and only if they are located in the same row and the same column.  This is important to remember as we're writing the code because the computer may generate the same node twice.  You'll see why when we get to the code, but if it does generate the same node we need to check for node equality.  The only way to do that is to define what it means to be equal.  <span class="important">Remember, two nodes are equal if and only if they have the same x and y values.</span></p>

	<p>We're going to spend most of our time in the <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> class.  We need to define a few new variables that we'll need.  In order to create the node map from a text file we need to get the text file first.  So when we create a <span class="cn">NodeGroup</span> object we give it the name and path of the text file we want to use.  This is what the <span class="var">level</span> variable is for.  It just holds the path and name of the file in a string format.  The <span class="var">grid</span> variable will hold the values in the text file as a 2D array.  We'll also use a stack so we need to <span class="kw">import</span> it at the beginning of the file.  We are also going to need numpy's <span class="mn">loadtxt</span> method so we need to import that.</p>

      <h4>Create new method called <span class="mn">createNodeList</span></h4>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>This is the main method that we'll call in order to make the node map from the file.  You'll notice that there are several methods that we haven't defined yet.  Those methods are defined below, but this method will give you an overview of what we are doing, then the methods will go into more detail.  We first load the text file into the <span class="var">grid</span> variable as a two-dimensional numpy array of strings.  We then call a method called <span class="mn">findFirstNode</span> which will find the first node in the <span class="var">grid</span> array and return it.  We need a starting point before we can begin.  Once we find that we add it to the stack.  We then start a while loop that will continue as long as the stack is not empty.  Once the stack is empty, then we are finished.  For each iteration through the loop we first pop off the top node from the stack.  We then add that node to the nodeList if it isn't in the nodeList already.  The method <span class="mn">addNode</span> takes care of that.  We then find all of the node's neighbors in all four directions, and add them to the node's neighbors dictionary.  Finally, we add all of the node's neighbors we just found to the stack.  This continues until we've popped off all of the nodes.</p>

      <h3>Creating the maze for the original Pacman game</h3>
      <p>Now that we have all of this code set up, we can use it for any text file of any size.  So instead of this tiny maze we've been using for testing, let's create the actual Pacmna maze we want to use in our game.  This maze is modeled after the actual Pacman maze from the first game, so it should look familiar to you.  Maybe not in text form, but once we run it, it will I hope.  Life doesn't have to be so hard.</p>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>This is the text file we'll be using for the actual maze.  We'll eventually make more for other mazes as well.  How many nodes are in this map?  I counted 66 nodes.  That's quite a bit and the other maps we'll create may have more or less nodes.  Maybe now you're happy that you don't actually have to connect these by hand.  Remember how much work it was to just connect 7 nodes together?  </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>That sure was a lot of code to do something that took us much less code to do.  It almost seems counter-productive.  Although it is true that if we only have a few nodes, then it is easier to just create and link them by hand, however, we don't just have a few nodes.  We're going to have many mazes and each maze can have up to 100 nodes in them.  If you want to take the time to link all of those nodes by hand, then be my guest.  The code in this section is going to save us a ton of time and we won't have to worry about accidently linking up nodes that aren't supposed to be linked or not linking nodes that are supposed to be linked.  This sort of task is the perfect job for a computer to handle.  Now we don't have to think about it again.  All we need to do is create the text files, and that's so much easier for us to handle.  This was a big section with a lot of code, so let's take it easy on the next section before we tackle another big one.  In the next section we're going to learn how to portal between two nodes.</p>
