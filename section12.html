    <h2>Section 12: Eat, Spawn, Repeat</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>I think that we are making some good progress.  Now that we have a place for the ghost to respawn we can make Pacman eat the ghost and have the ghost retreat to the ghost home and respawn back into the game.  I just had an idea for a Pacman-like game.  How about 4-player simulataneous play where each player is playing as one of the ghosts, and their goal is to stop the monster that is Pacman from eating their food supply?  That could be a fun spin, I'm not sure if it has been done yet.  Anyways, back to this game.  What we need to do is to get Pacman to collide with the ghost, which will be easy because we've already figured out how to do that with the pellets, so it'll pretty much be the same.  Then, after we detect a collision with the ghost, we need to check to make sure the ghost was in FREIGHT mode or not.  If he was in FREIGHT mode, then we need to change his mode to SPAWN mode.  In SPAWN mode we give him the home we just created as his goal, and set his speed to be faster than his maximum speed, maybe 1.5 or 2 times.  Then when he reaches his spawn point, he just returns back to the mode he was in previous to being in FREIGHT mode.  After a ghost has respawned, we don't return him to FREIGHT mode because a ghost can only be eaten once per power pellet.  Also, a ghost can only enter SPAWN mode if he was first in FREIGHT mode.  I'll provide a drawing of the flow of all of the modes within the game.  </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>So we're able to eat the power pellets which makes the ghosts vulnerable, allowing Pacman to eat them.  When Pacman does eat them, they run back to their home to respawn.  That all works really well, I know it may be tempting to add the other ghosts in now.  Let's hold off on that and deal with some other minor issues first.  Let's create a starting point for Pacman and the ghost when the level starts.  We also need the ghost to be able to kill Pacman.  We also want the level to restart when Pacman has eaten all of the pellets.  </p>
