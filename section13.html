    <h2>Section 13: Start and End Game States</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Right now we have Pacman and one ghost moving around the maze.  When the game starts, they are both in the upper left corner of the maze because we defined that node to be their starting node.  That's not where they are actually supposed to start though.  Pacman is supposed to begin the game in the lower middle part of the maze, and the ghost is supposed to start in the ghost home.  Also, it would be nice if the game didn't start automatically, but waited until we were ready.  It would also be nice if we could pause the game at any point.  We should also check when Pacman has eaten all of the pellets and restart the level when he does.  Oh, and if Pacman collides with the ghost while the ghost is not in FREIGHT mode, Pacman should lose a life and have the level restart.  I think that's a good amount of tasks for this section. </p>
    </div><!--End of Setup container-->


    <div class="container">
      <h3>Define Starting Positions</h3>
      <p>We want to define the starting positions for Pacman and the ghost.  Pacman starts between two nodes in the lower middle part of the maze.  We have to know which nodes to place him between though.  We're eventually going to modify the <span class="filenames">maze1.txt</span> file to do it for us automatically, but for now we'll just hard-code it in since we currently only have the one maze.  However, we will put the position of Pacman's starting node in the MAZEDATA dictionary since the starting node is level dependent.  All of this applies to the ghost as well.  </p>

      <h4>Modify the <span class="filenames">constants.py</span> file</h4>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>We're going to rewrite the MAZEDATA dictionary since it was getting kind of long and this breaks it up a bit.  The last line is the new line where we define the starting node for Pacman and the ghost.  For the ghost you'll notice that the starting position is the same as the respawn node.</p>

      <h3>Pausing the Game</h3>
      <p>Pausing a game isn't that hard of a concept.  We want to draw everything to the screen, we just don't update their positions so the objects appear to remain in a frozen state.  We will control the pausing and unpausing of the game with the spacebar.  It's nice to be able to pause the game, especially when we're developing it.  From the player viewpoint, it's nice to pause in case you need a bathroom break or something distracting is happening.  The original Pacman game didn't have a pause, but players expect to be able to pause their game at any point nowadays.  </p>

      <h3>Restarting the Level</h3>
      <p>There are two cases where we need to restart a level.  The first case is when Pacman eats all of the pellets.  When we have more mazes, then we'll put up different mazes after Pacman completes a level.  But since we only have one maze we just reset the maze and all of the initial starting conditions.  That's how the original Pacman games worked as well.  The second case is when Pacman loses a life by colliding with a ghost that is not in a FREIGHT mode.  When that happens the level is reset with the initial starting conditions, except for the pellets.  In this case we don't reset the pellets, unless you want to make the game really hard and frustrating.</p>
