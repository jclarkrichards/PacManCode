    <h2>Section 7: Giving the Ghosts AI</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Right now we have one ghost that moves around the maze in a random fashion.  This is fine, but we actually want to give the ghosts some sort of intelligence.  The main secret behind this is that we just need to give the ghosts a goal to reach.  The goal that we want the ghosts to reach is just a (x, y) position.  It doesn't even have to be reachable, and usually it won't be reachable.  Let's give our ghost a goal to reach to see how this works.</p>

      <p>What you should see after you do this is the ghost moving around in a circle in the upper left corner.  This is because the ghost is basically trying to reach the screen origin which is the upper left corner of the screen, but can't because of the restrictions we've placed on it.  Remember that it can't ever STOP during the game, so it has to choose a target every time it reaches a node, even if that target takes it further from the goal.  But if it is able to choose a target that takes it closer to the goal, it will.  What's nice about this is that we can give it any position on or off the screen and it will traverse the maze on its own trying to get to that position.  This is the heart behind the ghosts AI.  Next we need to understand something called Modes.  This will give our ghosts AI more sophistication.</p>
    </div><!--End of container-->
    
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setting up the Modes for the Ghosts</h3>
      <p>During the game, the ghosts are always in one of four different modes or states.  The main difference between the modes is the goal the ghost is trying to reach.  So, during the course of the game, we periodically change the ghost's modes which changes it's goals.  I'll explain more about this in a bit, but for now here are the four different modes and their general description:
      <dl>
	<dt>Scatter:</dt>
	<dd>This mode tells the ghosts to scatter to one of the four corners of the maze.  Each ghost has their own corner and I'll explain what they are when we start talking about the individual ghosts.  For now the corner we'll have our one ghost scatter to is the top left corner.</dd>
	<dt>Chase:</dt>
	<dd>This, like the scatter mode, is different for all of the ghosts.  I'll explain this in much more detail when we talk about the individual ghosts.  But, in general, each ghost has a way of tracking Pacman down.  The simplest of these is to just have Pacman's position as the goal.  Doing this will make the ghost follow Pacman wherever he goes like a lost puppy.  This is what we'll use for our test ghost since it's the simplest.</dd>
	<dt>Freight:</dt>
	<dd>We don't have to worry about this yet, but when Pacman eats a Power Pellet the ghosts are vulnerable and Pacman is able to eat them.  During this mode the ghosts move around the maze randomly and slower.</dd>
	<dt>Spawn:</dt>
	<dd>This is the mode the ghosts are in after Pacman eats them.  In this mode their goal is to get to their spawn location which we haven't defined yet.  They also move much faster in this mode.  </dd>
      </dl>
      Right now the two main Modes we need to worry about are Scatter and Chase.  We'll deal with the other modes in a future section.  There are a few other things we need to understand about the Scatter and Chase modes.  When the game first starts, all of the ghosts are in Scatter mode.  Scatter mode only lasts for 7 seconds, then automatically switches to Chase mode.  Chase mode then lasts for 20 seconds before switching back to Scatter mode.  These two modes switch back and forth during the game, however they don't switch indefinetly.  They only switch back and forth four times during a level.  The switches will look like the following:
      <ol>
	<li>Scatter 7 seconds</li>
	<li>Chase 20 seconds</li>
	<li>Scatter 7 seconds</li>
	<li>Chase 20 seconds</li>
	<li>Scatter 7 seconds</li>
	<li>Chase 20 seconds</li>
	<li>Scatter 5 seconds</li>
	<li>Chase for the rest of the level</li>
      </ol>

      So the ghosts only scatter a maximum of 4 times during any given level.  Let's have our test ghost follow this mode order.  We'll scatter him to the upper left corner of the screen, and during chase mode he'll follow Pacman around the maze.  He can't interact with Pacman yet though, so he may move past Pacman because he can't ever stop, and Pacman can.</p>

      <h3>Make a new class called <span class="cn">Mode</span></h3>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>We'll make a new class in the <span class="filenames">ghosts.py</span> file called <span class="cn">Mode</span>.  We need to place it before the <span class="cn">Ghost</span> class.  So when we create an object from the <span class="cn">Mode</span> class we specify the name of the mode, the time in seconds of how long the mode is supposed to last, and the speed that the ghosts need to be in during this mode.  This will actually be a speed multiplier.  So a speedMult of 1 means that the ghosts move at 100% of their max speed.  A speedMult of 0.5 means that they move at 50% of their max speed.  We define the ghosts max speed in the <span class="cn">Ghost</span> class as the speed.</p>

      <h4>Create a new method called <span class="mn">setupModeStack</span></h4>
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>It should be apparent by the name of the method that we're going to use a stack to manage the main two modes.  We're only putting these two modes in the stack because these are the only modes that happen at predictable times.  The other two modes are more like interrupt modes.  They'll interrupt the normal flow of the game, and we'll deal with them later.  But for now we'll just assume that these are the only two modes that exist.  These modes happen no matter what we do and we have no control over them.  Notice that the first mode we push to the stack is a CHASE mode and it doesn't have a time associated with it.  Didn't I say before that the first mode should be SCATTER with a time of 7 seconds?  Yes, that is true, but remember that in a stack the first thing you push to it will be the last thing you pop off of it.  So the first mode that we'll pop off when the game starts needs to be the last mode we push to the stack, which is what we have done here.</p>
