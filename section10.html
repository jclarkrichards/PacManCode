    <h2>Section 10: Chasing Ghosts</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>This section is all about giving Pacman a fighting chance.  Since he's able to eat the pellets he can now eat the power pellets and chase the ghosts around who are now trying to get away from him.  We'll start this section off by introducing the FREIGHT mode which leaves the ghosts vulnerable to being eaten by Pacman.  </p>

	<h3>FREIGHT Mode Overview</h3>
	<p>The ghosts currently have two modes that they can be in:  CHASE or SCATTER.  These modes have timers and switch back and forth when their timers expire.  We controlled this by putting them in a stack since the number of times the ghosts switch between the modes is set and doesn't change from level to level.  FREIGHT mode, however, is a mode that can happen at any time.  Well, it can only happen four times during a level since there are only four power pellets.  This is what I like to call an interrupt mode.  When Pacman eats a power pellet the ghosts can be in either SCATTER or CHASE mode.  When this happens we force all of the ghosts into FREIGHT mode whether they are in SCATTER or CHASE mode.  FREIGHT mode also has a timer and initially only lasts for 7 seconds.  This timer decreases as the levels increase to the point where it's practically non-existant.  In our game though, it will never drop below 1 second.  When the timer for FREIGHT mode expires the ghosts return back to the mode they were in prior to being forced into FREIGHT mode and continue that mode with the remaining time they had.  For example, if a ghost is in CHASE mode and has been in CHASE mode for 5 seconds prior to being forced into FREIGHT mode, then when the FREIGHT mode timer expires the ghost will return to CHASE mode with 15 seconds remaining since CHASE mode is 20 seconds long.  Being forced into FREIGHT mode basically just pauses the mode they are in and resumes where it left off when it is finished.  Also, in FREIGHT mode, the ghosts move a lot slower.  They move about 50% of their maximum speed and they choose directions randomly so they don't have a particular goal that they're trying to reach.  It's almost as if they are dazed and confused.  Right now this is all we want to program into our game, so lets get to it.</p>
