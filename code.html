    <p>You want to get into the dirty details of how to program your own Pac-Man game?  This is the right place.  I would suggest that you start with the design document.  This is a document that describes, in English, everything that needs to be included in the game.  When programming, we refer to this document often to make sure that we have included everything we wanted.  The design document isn't language specific, so you can use whether you're programming Pac-Man in Python or C++.  The Languages section describes the implementation in that specific language.  You should be able to follow the instructions to make your own skeleton version of Pac-Man in that language.  Right now I only have Python, but I hope to have more.  If you would like to share your own implementation in a certain language, then <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me and I'll include it, giving you full credit of course.</p>
