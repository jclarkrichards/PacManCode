    <h2>Section 6: Introduction to the Ghosts</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Moving the yellow circle around the maze almost feels like we're playing a game right?  But something is missing.  Well, for starters there aren't any enemies.  Without obstacles like enemies there's no challenge.  There's also no way of getting points, but we'll get to that later.  Everyone knows that in Pacman there are four Ghosts or Monsters depending on your generation.  I guess technically they're Monsters, but they look like Ghosts and I always thought they were supposed to be Ghosts, so I'm calling them Ghosts instead of Monsters.  The deal with them is that they're constantly trying to kill Pacman for whatever reason.  You may have also noticed that they all seem to have their own personalities.  They do have their own names:  Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.  In Ms Pacman they have different names I think, but we won't worry about that.  This section is just about the Ghosts in general.  We'll first get one of the Ghosts up and running around the maze with Pacman.  Then in a later section we'll get all four of them up there.  The Ghosts are actually the most complicated part of this game, so it's easier to just focus on one Ghost at this time.  Once we have that Ghost complete we can easily create as many Ghosts as we want with some minor changes for each Ghost to give them a unique personality.</p>
      <p>Before we get into writing any code for the Ghosts, lets try and understand how they move around the maze.  Like Pacman, the ghosts move around the maze from node to node.  So a lot of the code that we wrote for Pacman will also apply to the ghosts with some minor differences.  
	<h4>Basic Movement</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>When the ghosts are between nodes, i.e. traveling from one node to another, they cannot reverse direction (except in a couple of special cases)</li>
	<li>When the ghosts get to a node, they can go in any valid direction except in the direction from which they just came.  So for example, if a ghost is moving LEFT while he enters a node, and the node has neighbors in all directions, then the ghost can move in any of those directions except for RIGHT. So no backtracking.</li>
	<li>The player doesn't choose the directions for the ghosts like they do for Pacman, so the ghosts move entirely on their own.</li>
	<li>The ghosts choose a direction when entering a node based on which direction will get them closer to their goal they are trying to reach.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    </div><!--End of Setup container-->


    <div class="container">
      <h3>Create a new file called <span class="filenames">entities.py</span></h3>
      <p>So it makes sense (at least to me) that since Pacman and the Ghosts move around the maze in similar ways we should create a generic class from which they both can inherit.  The class should describe any object that can move around the maze in a basic sense.  Then we can use the Pacman and Ghost classes to be more specific in how they move around the maze.  This way we're not writing the same code in multiple classes.  We may also want to have other objects that move around the maze.  So in the new file let's create a class called <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> because the most generic object I can think of moving around a maze is a mouse.  Any object that inherits from this class will have the basic ability to move around the maze on its own.  If you can think of a better name, then go ahead.  I was never very good at naming things.  The most important thing is that it's memorable and descriptive.  Naming it something like <span class="cn">GenericEntity</span> isn't very descriptive or memorable.</p>
      <h4>Create new class called <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span></h4>
      
      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>If we were to just create an object out of <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> then you would just see a white circle sitting on top of the first node doing nothing.  If we were to give it a direction then it would move in that direction until it couldn't move in that direction anymore and come to a stop.  Pretty boring, but in the classes that will inherit from this class we define their movements more specifically.  This does everything we need all of our objects that move around the maze to do.  I'm writing out the entire class even though we've written most of this code in the <span class="cn">Pacman</span> class.  Since we're going to have <span class="cn">Pacman</span> inherit from this class we can remove all of these methods from the Pacman class.  We'll get to that later.  Right now I shouldn't have to explain what all of these methods do since there isn't anything new here.</p>

      <h3>Modify the <span class="filenames">pacman.py</span> file</h3>
      <p>Since we created this <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> class we are going to have Pacman inherit from it.  By inheriting we're saying that <span class="cn">Pacman</span> is a <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span>.  Anything that <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> can do, <span class="cn">Pacman</span> can do to.  </p>

      <div class="pseudoCode">
	<p>In order to inherit from <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> we need to import it first.  Then when creating the class instead of saying <span class="mn">object</span> which is the generic class all classes inherit from, we'll say <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span>.  Then in the <span class="mn">__init__</span> method we need to call <span class="cn">MazeMouses</span> <span class="mn">__init__</span> as well.  This way, any variables or methods that are defined inside of <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> are useable by <span class="cn">Pacman</span>.  What's nice about this is that since we can put all of the generic stuff inside of <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> we can focus on what's unique about <span class="cn">Pacman</span>.  So we can actually go ahead and delete anything in <span class="cn">Pacman</span> that we moved over to <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span>.  That goes for all of the variables except for <span class="var">name</span> and <span class="var">color</span>.  The methods we can delete are <span class="mn">setPosition</span>, <span class="mn">moveBySelf</span>, <span class="mn">overshotTarget</span>, <span class="mn">reverseDirection</span>, <span class="mn">setNextTarget</span>, <span class="mn">portal</span>, and <span class="mn">render</span>.  When you're finished, the only methods in <span class="cn">Pacman</span> right now are <span class="mn">__init__</span>, <span class="mn">getValidKey</span>, <span class="mn">update</span>, and <span class="mn">moveByKey</span>.  You're probably wondering why we didn't delete the <span class="mn">update</span> method from <span class="cn">Pacman</span>.  After all, <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> has an <span class="mn">update</span> method as well.  That's fine, if we have a method in the <span class="cn">Pacman</span> class that has the same name in the <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> class, then the method in the <span class="cn">Pacman</span> class will override the one in the <span class="cn">MazeMouse</span> class.  If you go ahead and run the game you shouldn't notice any difference.  That's good, there shouldn't be any difference, if there is then we messed up somewhere.  </p>

      <p>We're going to make the ghost move around the maze randomly at first.  This is the easiest way to make the ghost move around by itself.  We'll actually use it in part of the game, so let's learn how to do it now.  We need to first import a random generator.  Python has one built in, so we'll use that.  We need to make two brand new methods called callsed <span class="cn">getValidDirections</span> and <span class="mn">randomDirection</span>.  The <span class="mn">getValidDirections</span> method will build a list of directions that the ghost can travel in and return that list to whoever is calling it.  We'll expand on this when we add more restrictions to the directions the ghosts can travel in.  The <span class="mn">randomDirection</span> just gets a random direction to move in by first getting a list of valid directions then randomly choosing one.  We'll also override the default <span class="mn">moveBySelf</span> method.  We don't ever have to worry about the ghost stopping, as it can never stop once the game starts.  It will always move in a new direction when reaching a node, or in the same direction.</p>

I'll explain it when we get there, but just in case we're left with no directions then we can force the ghost to backtrack since that's the only direction he can move in when this situation occurs.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Try running the program now.  You'll notice that the ghost moves around the maze by itself, and it will never backtrack or double-back on itself.  This is a good first step in understanding how the ghosts move around the maze.  Again, we're only dealing with one ghost for now.  One issue is that the ghost currently moves around in random directions.  There are a lot of clones out there that will just stop here and figure that this is good enough.  However, in the original Pacman game you know that the ghosts didnt' move around randomly.  They were actually trying to get you!  We need to instill some kind of AI into our ghosts.  In the next section we'll deal with that and we'll also deal with the different modes the ghosts can be in and what that means.</p>
