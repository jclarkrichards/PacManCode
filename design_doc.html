      <p>The document explains the logic and rules that we need in order to code the game.

	  <h3>Overview<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p><img src="Images/action1.png" alt="image" width=20% height=20%/>For the most part I think anybody reading this knows how a game of Pacman plays out.  If you don't, then I would highly suggest that you stop reading this and go play a few games of Pacman so you can get an idea of the game.  Like I mentioned before, my goal is not to get the most accurate representation of Pacman, but just to get something that plays similar to it.  Certain rules might be different than the actual game.  For example, all of the bonus fruit in the original game only appear on certain levels and award the player with predefined points.  The cherry, for example, gives the player 100 points and appears in the first level.  My point system for the bonuses will be different and I'll be using different fruits like pineapples and lemons.  I also won't have the Galaxian ship as a bonus.  The point is that my game won't be a carbon copy of the original.  </p>
	</li>

	<li id="gamestartlink">
	  <h3>Game Start<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>At the start of the game Pacman appears between two nodes.  Those two nodes depend on the map being used and will be described later.  Pacman also starts facing to the left.  The ghosts start in the ghost home, except for Blinky who starts directly above the home.  The home can only fit three ghosts and from left to right they are Inky, Pinky, and Clyde.  The game starts with the game paused so that the player can choose when to start the game.  The player would just need to press the spacebar in order to start the game.  When the player presses the spacebar Pacman will automatically move towards the left.  Blinky will automatically move towards the left as well.  Pinky will automatically leave the ghost home.  Inky and Clyde will move up and down inside the ghost home.  </p>
	</li>

	<hr/>
	<li id="mapslink">
	  <h3>Maps<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>There will be several maps instead of just one.  The original Pacman game only had one map.  Ms. Pacman had 5 maps I think.  This game will have the original Pacman map and the Ms. Pacman maps.  There may or may not be more maps that I will define myself.  So as of this writing there will only be a total of 6 maps.  The maps will rotate as the level increases.  The maps will change every other level or on every odd level.  So, the player will play the first map on levels 1 and 2, the second map on levels 3 and 4, the third map on levels 5 and 6, and so on.  So if the level is an odd numbered level and is not the first level, then we increment the maps.  If we were on the last map, then we go back to the first map.  It would also be nice to be able to generate random maps on the fly.  As of this writing that is not possible, but is one of the goals.  Each map also has at least one pair of portals which are always on the edges of the screen.  The first map, for example, has one pair of portals on the left and right edges of the screen.  The portals allow Pacman and the ghosts to travel from one side of the screen to the other side.  When the ghosts move towards or away from portals, they will move at half of their max speed.  Portals always come in pairs and can also be placed at the top and bottom edges of the screen.  </p>

	<li id="pelletslink">
	  <h3>Pellets<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>Each maze should have 244 total pellets.  There are 240 normal pellets which are worth 10 points each.  There are also 4 power pellets which are worth 50 points each.  The power pellets need to be placed in the four corners on each maze.  The exact locations of those corners are defined for each maze and can't be specified here.  When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts enter Freight mode.  If Pacman eats another power pellet while the ghosts are in Freight mode, then the Freight mode timer resets instead of the Freight mode time being added to the previous Freight mode time.  All of that is explained in the Freight mode section.  The power pellets also flash on and off every half of a second to make it easy for the player to see how many power pellets are left.</p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="ghosthomelink">
	  <h3>Ghost Home<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>This is the area of the screen that only the ghosts can enter.  Pacman is not allowed to enter the ghost home ever.  Pinky, Inky, and Clyde start the game inside the ghost home.  After the ghosts leave the home, they can only reenter after Pacman eats them during Freight mode.  At the start of the game Pinky exits the home immediately.  Inky leaves the home only after Pacman has eaten 30 pellets.  Clyde leaves the home after Pacman has eaten 60 pellets.  If, however, Pacman is not eating any pellets, then Inky will leave if 5 seconds passes without any pellets being eaten.  The same thing applies to Clyde, except only after Inky has left.  While Inky and Clyde are inside the ghost home waiting to leave, they move up and down.  The ghosts never stop moving.</p>

	<li id="pacmanlink">
	  <h3>Pacman<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The player-controlled character.  The player controls Pacman using the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT keys on the keyboard.  Pacman automatically moves in the direction he is facing.  So the player does not need to hold down a direction key in order to move Pacman.  In order to change direction, the player needs to be holding down the key he wishes to move when Pacman enters a node.  If that direction exists, then Pacman will start moving in that direction.  If that direction does not exist, then Pacman will just continue in his current direction.  If Pacman cannot continue in his current direction and no keys are being pressed, then Pacman comes to a rest.  He can only rest on a node and not between nodes.  When Pacman is at rest, his mouth remains open in the direction he is facing.  Pacman only collides with Ghosts, Pellets, and Bonus Fruit.  </p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="ghostslink">
	  <h3>Ghosts<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The main thing to say about the ghosts is that they are only interested in reaching a position.  That position might be Pacman's position or some other unreachable position.  The position that they are trying to reach depends on the mode in which they are in.  For more information on the modes, check out the mode section.  The ghosts don't move as fast as Pacman initially.  For the first few levels they're speed is slightly slower than Pacman's.  But after the fifth level they're speed is just as fast as Pacman's for the remainder of the game.  </p>

	<li id="blinkylink">

	<li id="modeslink">
	  <h3>Ghost Modes<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>There are four modes that the ghosts can be in.  At any one time during the game, the ghosts can be in any of these modes.  Any of the ghosts does not have to be in the same mode as any of the other ghosts.  Most of the modes have time limits, only the Spawn mode does not have a time limit.  The main difference between the modes is the point of interest assigned to each of the ghosts.  The point of interest tells the ghost where he needs to be, and the ghost will try to get there.  This point of interest does not have to be reachable by the ghost.  The points of interest is what gives the ghosts their AI.</p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="scatterlink">
	  <h3>Scatter Mode<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>During the scatter mode the ghosts retreat to their respective corners of the maze.  This mode occurs 4 times during any level.  This mode only lasts for 7 seconds.  The ghosts are given points of interest to accomplish this as described below.  If the ghosts remained in scatter mode then they would just circle around their respective corners of the maze.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Blinky:  The point of interest is the top right corner.</li>
	      <li>Pinky:  The point of interest is the top left corner.</li>
	      <li>Inky:  The point of interest is the bottom right corner.</li>
	      <li>Clyde:  The point of interest is the bottom left corner.</li>
	  </ul></p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="chaselink">
	  <h3>Chase Mode<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The points of interest for each ghost in this mode are a bit more complicated than the other modes.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Blinky:</li>
	      <li>Pinky:</li>
	      <li>Inky:</li>
	      <li>Clyde:</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="freightlink">
	  <h3>Freight Mode<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The ghosts enter freight mode only after Pacman eats a power pellet.  Since there are only four power pellets in any level, the ghosts can only enter freight mode four times during a level.  During freight mode the ghosts don't have points of interest.  Whenever they reach a junction they randomly decide which direction to move in.  You can think of this mode as the confusion mode for the ghosts.  They also move a lot slower in this mode.  They'll move at 50% of their maximum speed.  This mode lasts for 7 seconds for the first few levels, and then steadily decreases by one second after level 5, and then remains at 1 second for the rest of the game.  During this mode the ghosts will also change color so that they are all the same color.  This is the only time Pacman can eat the ghosts.  If Pacman eats a ghost during freight mode the game pauses for half a second and both Pacman and the ghost disappear while a small score is displayed.  After that little pause, Pacman reappears and the ghost enters spawn mode.  The points for eating each ghost doubles for each consecutive ghost on a single power pellet.  So if Pacman can successfully eat all four ghosts on a single Power pellet, then he is awarded 200, 400, 800, and 1600 points for each ghost respectively.  Since there are four power pellets on each level, the player can achieve this four times.  </p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="spawnlink">
	  <h3>Spawn Mode<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The ghosts enter spawn mode only if they were previously in freight mode and were eaten by Pacman.  During this mode only their eyes are displayed and their point of interest is the ghost home.  This is also the only time they are allowed to re-enter the ghost home.  Once they arrive at the ghost home they are given their body back and they immediately exit the home and enter into whatever mode they were in prior to entering freight mode.  So once they exit the ghost home they will be in either chase mode or scatter mode.  The ghosts also move much faster during this mode, say 150% of their maximum speed.  The point is to get them home as quickly as possible so they can get back to the action.</p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="bonuslink">
	  <h3>Bonus Fruit<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>Twice per level a fruit will appear in a predetermined location in the maze.  This location might be different depending on the maze.  The bonus fruit is stationary and does not move.  The first bonus fruit appears after Pacman has eaten 70 pellets.  The second bonus fruit will appear after Pacman has eaten 170 pellets.  The bonus fruit will remain until either Pacman collides with the bonus fruit or after 10 seconds has passed.  In either case the bonus fruit disappears.  If Pacman collides with the bonus fruit, then the value of the bonus fruit will be added to the score.  If Pacman dies while the bonus fruit is being displayed, then it goes away and Pacman loses the chance to collect it.  If Pacman successfully collects the bonus fruit, then each unique fruit will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.  If Pacman collects two or more apples, then only one apple will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.  Below is a short description of each fruit and the number of points associated with each fruit.  </p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="liveslink">
	  <h3>Lives<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>Pacman starts the game with 3 extra lives.  The extra lives show up at the bottom left of the screen.  The location of the extra life icons is not dependant on the maps.  There can only be a maximum of 5 extra lives.  When Pacman collides with a ghost and the ghost is not in Freight mode, then Pacman will lose a life and one of the life icons at the bottom of the screen will disappear.  When there are no more extra life icons at the bottom of the screen and Pacman collides with a ghost while the ghost is not in Freight mode, then the game is over.  Pacman can gain an extra life every 5,000 points.  That number is subject to change.  I'm not sure if that is too frequent or not frequent enough.  The player shouldn't be gaining extra lives on every level.  </p>
	</li>
	<hr/>
	<li id="gameoverlink">
	  <h3>Game Over<a href="#tableofcontents">back</a></h3>
	  <p>The game is over when Pacman has no more extra lives and collides with a ghost while the ghost is not in Freight mode.  When this occurs the game is paused, Pacman performs his death animations, and the words Game Over will appear in the middle of the screen.  After a few seconds, the player will automatically be taken to the title screen.  Then the player can decide to either play again, or quit the game.</p>
