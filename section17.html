    <h2>Section 17: Defining the Ghost's Start</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>We're almost finished with Phase I!  That's exciting.  Just a couple more sections to go.  In this section we are going to give the ghost's their own starting positions.  Right now, if you play our game, the ghosts all start on the same node.  They basically just start on top of each other.  There's nothing wrong with this and we could just leave it as it is.  But, then what would have been the point of creating all of those extra home nodes?  </p>
      <p><img src="Images/homenodes.png" alt=""/>The image on the right shows the home nodes with the four ghosts in their starting positions.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Blinky starts on node 1</li>
	<li>Inky starts on node 2</li>
	<li>Pinky starts on node 3</li>
	<li>Clyde starts on node 4</li>
      </ul>
</p>When they all leave the ghost home, they should move towards the LEFT.  Why the LEFT?  I don't know, seems arbitrary to me, we can just as easily have them move to the RIGHT.  Or we could just have them decide which direction to move.  But in our game we are going to have them move towards the LEFT whenever they leave the ghost home.  Notice that Blinky does not start in the ghost home.  At the start of the game, therefore, he should move towards the LEFT as if he just left the home.  Also, all of the ghosts don't leave the home immediately.  At the start of the game, Pinky leaves the home immediately, but Inky and Clyde move UP and DOWN until they are allowed to leave the home.  When they are allowed to leave the home, they follow a direct path out of the home instead of deciding which node to go to next.  Below are some images of how Inky behave inside of the ghost home and the path he must take when he leaves the home.</p>
<p><img src="Images/inkystart3.png" alt="" width=300 height=300/><img src="Images/inkystart2.png" alt="" width=300 height=300/><img src="Images/inkystart1.png" alt="" width=300 height=300/></p>
<hr/>
<p>In the first two images we see Inky moving UP and DOWN.  He continues to move UP and DOWN until he is allowed to leave.  When he is allowed to leave we give him direct instructions on which directions he must follow in order to leave the home.  When he reaches his home node he must go RIGHT, then UP, then LEFT.  Clyde has the same behavior, except just on the other side.  When Clyde has to leave home he follows the instructions of LEFT, UP, LEFT.  We'll refer to these images when we get to the code below.</p>

      <p>Now we have Inky and Clyde bouncing UP and DOWN inside of the home area.  They will continue to do this until we tell them that it is time to leave.  How do we know whether it is time for them to leave?  There are a couple of ways we are going to determine that.  The main way we'll determine when they can leave is by how many pellets Pacman has eaten.  Inky can leave when Pacman eats 30 pellets, and Clyde can leave when Pacman has eaten 60 pellets.  We don't want this to be the only control though since the player could just not eat any pellets for awhile and keep Inky and Clyde in the home for a really long time.  I mean, they wouldn't be able to finish the level, but we want to check the idleTimer variable and force Inky and Clyde out of the home after 10 seconds of inactivity.  That'll be easy since we've already implemented an idleTimer.</p>

      <h3>Guiding the Ghosts our of their Home</h3>
      <p>I hope that you've been playing the game with every change that we make, and not just typing stuff in blindly.  If you did happen to run the code up to this point, then you'll notice that Inky and Clyde bounce UP and DOWN inside the ghost home until the conditions that we specified are met.  If those conditions are met then they leave the home.  But depending on where Pacman is at the time you'll notice that it takes them some time to find the exit.  We need to actually guide them out of the home before we release them into the wild.  Like I mentioned at the very beginning of this section with the images, we need to give them specific directions on how to leave the home before they're allowed to make their own decisions on where to go.  We only need to do this for Inky and Clyde as well.  That's because Blinky doesn't start inside of the home, and Pinky immediately exits the home.  </p>
      <p>What we have so far is that we start the game with the <span class="var">exitHome</span> variable, that every <span class="cn">Ghost</span> has, set to <span class="py">False</span> for Inky and Clyde and <span class="py">True</span> for Blinky and Pinky.  What this does is it removes the LEFT and RIGHT directions from their <span class="var">validDirections</span>.  This restricts them to only moving UP and DOWN.  When certain conditions are met, whatever they may be, we set the <span class="var">exitHome</span> variable to <span class="py">True</span>.  Now they are allowed to move LEFT and RIGHT.  </p>
      <p>In order to guide them out we can use another variable called <span class="var">guideDog</span> or something that is usually <span class="py">False</span>.  However, when we release Inky and Clyde we set it to <span class="py">True</span>.  While this variable is <span class="py">True</span> we clear out their <span class="var">validDirections</span> list and instead put in the only direction we want them to go.  We can do that with a Stack or a Queue, but we'll use a Stack since we have one written up, and it's been awhile since we've used it.  So Inky, for example, will have three directions in this Stack:  [RIGHT, UP, LEFT].  We pop off each direction and set it in his <span class="var">validDirections</span> list until the stack is empty, at which point we set the <span class="var">guideDog</span> variable to <span class="py">False</span>.  Thereafter, Inky will continue on his merry way of trying to kill Pacman.  So now that we have an understanding of what we want to do, let's get it coded up.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Now we have all of the ghosts moving like we want them to move.  They all have their own unique AI that will differentiate them from each other.  Playing the game should really feel like Pacman now without the graphics.  There are some things that you'll notice if you're really familiar with Pacman that are different.  We'll discuss those issues in a bit.  In the next section we'll take care of the last major bit which is giving the ghosts their own starting points.</p>
