    <h2>On Making Clones</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>Why make a clone of a game when you can make your own unique game? That's a question I'm sure a lot of people ask themselves when they see people like me making a popular game like Pacman. I have made my own unique games, but making clones of video games that I like is like being in a cover band. Cover bands, or tribute bands, exist because the members of those bands really like the source material whether it's the songs or the look or whatever. They're saying that they really like the band so much that they want to show their love by mimicking them. A lot of popular bands started out as tribute bands as well because writing songs is hard, apparently, I've never tried. But when you start a tribute band you at least have songs that have already been established to be popular. You eventually learn to write your own songs. Writing video games is sort of like that. When you're starting out it's hard to write your own unique game. It's good practice to pick a simple game you enjoy and try to mimic that game with your own implementation. This will at least give you some confidence and practice to write your own games.</p>
