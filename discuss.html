      <p>This would be a place where people can get together and discuss Pac-Man and share their implementations of Pac-Man that they have made.  They would create an account and login in order to leave comments.  People who don't create an account can only read the comments.  This isn't something that will happen until much later.  Need a way to monitor comments as well.  Maybe when a lot of people start viewing this site I can activate this.  So, at first, it won't even be here.</p>
