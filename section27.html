    <h2>Section 27:  Final Touches</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>So is this the final section or not?  I don't know yet, but all I do know is that there are still plenty of things to do to make our game better.  </p>
      <p>Things to do checklist:
      <ul>
	<li>Reduce the size of the pellets</li>
	<li>Make the power pellets flash</li>
	<li>Make the level flash when the level is complete</li>
	<li>Make the ghosts flash when they leave FREIGHT</li>
	<li>When the player pauses the game Pacman, the ghosts, and the displayed fruit disappear.</li>
	<li>When Pacman eats a ghost, both Pacman and the eaten ghost disappear during the pause time.</li>
	<li>When Pacman dies the ghosts should disappear so the player can see the death animation.</li>
	
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>This section is more than just a clever title, there are things in games that flash.  A good reason to make items flash in a game is to get the player's attention.  If you want the player to be aware of something, then make that thing flash.  Making something flash is easy.  You just periodically switch between drawing that object and not drawing that object.  Or you can make something flash by periodically changing the image that represents that object.  In Pacman, we need to make the power pellets flash continuously by turning the drawing of the power pellets on and off.  Also, when the ghosts are in FREIGHT mode we need to let the player know that they are about to leave FREIGHT mode by making them flash for about 1 second before they turn back to normal.  That way the player knows when to get away from them.  When the player finishes a level, the background images of the level flash white a few times before moving on to the next level.  Those are the only two instances in Pacman where things flash, but you can make other items flash.  Maybe you can make the fruit flash before it's about to disappear.  The point is we want to make something pretty general that any object can use instead of making it specific for the two cases described above.    </p>

	<h3>Disappear During Player Pause</h3>
	<p>When the player pauses the game everything freezes in place and the word "PAUSE" appears in the middle of the screen.  This is how things currently are.  This if fine, but when the player pauses the game I don't want to have Pacman, the ghosts, or the fruit (if on screen) to be displayed.  This is a common thing to prevent people from planning out a strategy while the game is paused.  My main motivation is that since I'm displaying text on the screen in the play area while the game is paused it seems kind of sloppy if there's another object in that same play area which makes it hard to read the text.  </p>

	<h4>Modify the <span class="filenames">gamecontrol.py</span> method</h4>
	<h4>Modify the <span class="mn">render</span> method</h4>
	<div class="pseudoCode">
	  <p>The variable playerPaused is True whenever the player pauses the game by pressing the space bar.  Right now the game starts with this set to True.

Maybe during those 5 seconds we want to play a little jingle as well.

	<h3>Make the Level Flash When a Level is Completed</h3>
	<p>When you eat all of the pellets you need a way to let the player know that he did it and the level is complete.  Right now the game just pauses when the last pellet is eaten before moving on to the next level.  We actually want the level to flash a few times before moving on to the next level.  What do I mean by having the level flash?  Well if you look on the spritesheet you'll notice that for every level (the bottom rows of the spritesheet) you'll notice that there are two sets of level images.  There's a set on the left half of the sheet and on the right half.  We've been using the sets on the left half of the sheet to draw our mazes.  We can just as easily use the sets on the right half, though they'll look slightly different.  When we flash the maze at the completion of the level we will basically just flip between these two different versions of the maze background.</p>
	<p><img src="Images/spritesheet.png" alt=""/>Looking at the spritesheet on the right you'll see what I mean by the two sets of maze images per row.  Remember that in order to draw the maze sprites we pass in the background and just draw the maze sprites directly to the background.  That way, during gameplay, we just need to worry about drawing the background instead of each individual maze sprite.  So why don't we just make a second background and draw the second set of maze sprites to that background?  There's no reason why we can't.  During normal gameplay we just don't draw that background to the screen.  But when the player completes the level we'll just flip between the two backgrounds every half a second or so.  </p>
